        <description>&lt;p&gt;Remain still, that is the key. But what does it mean? Does it mean to just be quiet, to be silent, to try to stop the waterfall of thoughts? Does stillness mean to be in a deeply meditative state? Or maybe is just to be with oneself and pay attention to the breath, or to a line of light reflected on the wall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying meditation, focusing on my breathing, trying to be one with the universe by connecting with the present moment. May be it sounds abstract and cliché, but that is exactly what I’ve been doing for some time now, let say a year and a half. Does it have some result? Do I see some difference in my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still caotic somehow, I still feel sad or scratching depression sometimes. But I also must admit that I see some change, sometimes I am in peace, in silence and happy. I even have seen the light, that bright, white, immense light covering everything and feeling deeply satisfied and full of peace. I saw a dove, I saw some bird wings at some other point, I heard the words: “Free”, “Don’t get in your way”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had those experiences, and yet I am not a saint, not even a super calm, patient person. I still have my dark sides, I still talk loud when I am angry. I wish I can say that remaining still is an outcome that is reacheable in a short period of time. I don’t even know if that is possible. I mean, maybe stillness is a result that only span for short periods of time. Perhaps I will discover that one day. Maybe after long practice of being here, now, in the present moment, one can say: “I am still. I can remain still in every situation”.&lt;/p&gt;
